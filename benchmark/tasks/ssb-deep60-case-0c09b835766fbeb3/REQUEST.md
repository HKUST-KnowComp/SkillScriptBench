# User Request

Audit and repair the complete supplied skill package. Inspect SKILL.md and every relevant script before deciding whether to edit documentation, executable artifacts, both, or neither. Preserve public interfaces and unrelated behavior. Leave an already-correct package unchanged.

## Observed problem

DICOM pseudonyms can be derived from a field keyword instead of their scope.

## Required behavior

Derive each DICOM pseudonym token from the configured pseudonym scope.


## Package Maintenance Contract

Audit all documented local invocations in this package, not only the example above.
With valid user inputs substituted for placeholders, commands, arguments, paths,
and generated artifacts must agree with the supplied implementation and the
stated use case. Preserve existing supported invocations and unrelated behavior.
Do not delete a documented workflow merely to avoid repairing it.
